            Welcome to my ToDo app built with VueJS! <br>
            I created this app to learn and improve my skills in VueJS.
            It helps you keep track of your tasks with a clean and minimalist interface,
            allowing you to add new tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them.
            I practiced core concepts of VueJS such as components, directives, data binding,
            validation, and routing while also incorporating local storage to persist your tasks.
