# vue-todo

Welcome to my simple ToDo app built with VueJS! This app was created as a personal project to learn and improve my skills in VueJS, practicing core concepts such as components, directives, data binding, and routing. The app helps you keep track of your tasks with a clean and minimalist interface, allowing you to add new tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them.
